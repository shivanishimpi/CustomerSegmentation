# CustomerSegmentation

### Outputs the following values- 
* Two customers who are no longer TGI customers said they would be interested in coming back but are price sensitive.
* Two customers who are no longer TGI customers are interested in returning; though, TGI may prefer not for them to come back.
* One customer who is still a customer asked for a quote to another line of insurance products (automobile). This was a pleasant surprise and may provide future up-selling opportunities.
* The client confirmed the robustness of the model that they suggested using this model monthly to identify and prioritize existing customers and potential customers that would return to the company.
